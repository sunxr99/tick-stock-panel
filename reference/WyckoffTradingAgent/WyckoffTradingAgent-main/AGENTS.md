# Wyckoff-Analysis Development Rules

> This file is the single source of truth for code quality rules.
> All AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) MUST follow these rules.

## Project Overview

Multi-market quantitative analysis system based on Wyckoff method, covering A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, US stocks, and ETFs. Python backend (CLI + MCP) + React/TypeScript web frontend.

Streamlit is fully retired from `main`: do not add, restore, or maintain Streamlit runtime code here. The historical Streamlit MVP code is preserved on the `release/streamlit` branch, and its product architecture/screenshots are archived in [docs/STREAMLIT_MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/STREAMLIT_MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Python
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -x -q  # run tests
.venv/bin/ruff check .                   # lint
.venv/bin/ruff format --check .          # format check
.venv/bin/python scripts/quality_gate.py --ci  # function length + LOC trend
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_workflow_hygiene.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_dependency_hygiene.py

# Web (from web/ directory)
pnpm dev                                 # dev server
pnpm build                               # production build
pnpm -r exec tsc --noEmit                # typecheck
pnpm --filter @wyckoff/web test
pnpm --filter @wyckoff/api test
```

## Hard Rules (CI enforced, will block merge)

1. **Pass quality gate** — `.venv/bin/python scripts/quality_gate.py --ci` must pass function-length hard limits. LOC growth warnings are review signals, not automatic failures.

2. **Pass ruff check** — All Python code must pass `ruff check .` with the project config in `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Pass ruff format** — All Python code must be formatted with `ruff format`.

4. **Pass TypeScript strict mode** — Web code must compile with `tsc --noEmit` (strict: true, noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters).

5. **Pass pytest** — All tests must pass. Tests must not make real network calls.

6. **Pass PR policy** — Every non-automated PR must have Markdown headings for both `Summary`/`变更摘要` and `Validation`/`验证`. It must not include secrets, local logs, traces, database dumps, or key material.

7. **Pass workflow hygiene** — Changes to `.github/workflows/` must retain least-privilege top-level permissions, concurrency for automation workflows, artifact upload when a job prepares logs, and environment indirection for shell inputs. The A-share funnel and Step4/OMS entrypoints must keep their shared concurrency group.

8. **Pass dependency hygiene** — Dependency changes must preserve `uv.lock` and `web/pnpm-lock.yaml`, and the lockfile must be updated with its manifest. Do not introduce `latest`, wildcard, unpinned remote, or runtime-resolved dependencies.

9. **Pass operational smoke checks** — A change that can affect daily jobs, funnel execution, data writes, or integrations must pass the CI smoke dry-run as well as its focused tests. A queued or in-progress run is not evidence of success.

## Review Rules (strong expectations, not mechanically CI-enforced)

1. **Function length target ≤ 50 lines; hard limits by layer** — 50 lines remains the design target, not a mechanical wall. New functions block merge only when they exceed the layer hard limit enforced by `scripts/quality_gate.py`: default/core/agents/tools/integrations/workflows/shared packages ≤70 lines, scripts/CLI orchestration ≤100 lines, React route pages ≤120 lines, React components/app glue ≤90 lines. Whitelisted legacy functions are tracked as visible debt in `.metrics/func_whitelist.json`; they may remain temporarily over limit, but must not grow longer.

2. **No redundant code** — Every function, variable, and abstraction must earn its existence. Review aggressively for wrapper functions whose body is a single forwarded call, variables assigned once and immediately returned, one-off abstractions with no clear reuse/design value, and re-exports that add no boundary clarity.

3. **No code bloat** — If 30 lines can do the job, don't write 50. Code volume is tracked in `.metrics/loc.json`; growth >5% without corresponding feature additions is a warning that must be explained or paid down.

4. **No dead code** — Don't leave unused imports, commented-out blocks, or unreachable branches. Delete them.

5. **Comments: only when WHY is non-obvious** — Don't explain what code does. Don't reference tickets or tasks. Only explain hidden constraints or surprising behavior.

6. **No debug artifacts** — Don't commit `console.log`, `breakpoint()`, `TODO/FIXME`, temporary dumps, or `print("debug")`-style traces. In `core/`, `integrations/`, `tools/`, and `agents/`, use logging instead of print-style diagnostics. In `scripts/` and `cli/`, user-facing progress/output via `print()` is allowed.

## Strategy Evidence Rules (策略结论的证据要求)

These exist because ad-hoc reimplementations of production signal logic produced three
wrong conclusions in a single day (2026-08-20): the dry-volume channel was nearly deleted
based on a hand-rolled "20-day min volume / 60-day mean" proxy when production uses a
250-day quantile; Spring was judged MA-damaged from an 11-symbol/day sample; and SOS was
reported at +0.43pct excess when a consistent-universe rerun showed −0.80pct. Each time
the error direction favored acting. So:

1. **Never hand-roll a proxy for production signal logic** — To evaluate a gate or signal,
   drive it through the production path (`scripts/backtest_runner.py`, `core/backtest_replay.py`,
   `scripts/diagnose_funnel_recall.py`) so the tested definition is the shipped definition.
   If a proxy is unavoidable, state it as a proxy in the output and never let it justify a
   parameter change on its own.

2. **Report net of cost, and state the universe** — Gross excess is not a result. Subtract
   `core.trade_friction.round_trip_cost_pct()` (currently ~0.202% A-share round trip) and
   print the per-day candidate count. A conclusion whose gain is smaller than the cost is
   not actionable no matter how clean the sign.

3. **Watch for survivorship from `dropna`** — Joining many indicator columns silently drops
   symbols that lack any one of them, and the dropped set is usually not random. Log the
   surviving universe size per day; if two runs of the "same" rule differ several-fold in
   hit count, treat both as void until reconciled.

4. **Beta is not alpha** — Absolute return rising with holding period while excess stays
   negative means the signal is only capturing market drift. Say so explicitly rather than
   quoting the absolute number.

5. **One segment is not evidence** — A single market phase (e.g. a rally) cannot establish
   a directional claim. Require the sign to hold across regimes, or label the finding as
   segment-specific. `45%–55%` of days positive is noise, not direction.

6. **Prefer "no change" when the evidence is self-contradictory** — Reversing an earlier
   measurement is normal; acting on the reversal within the same session is not. Record the
   correction, keep production as-is, and let the scheduled evaluators accumulate samples.

7. **Single-change evidence only shortlists; the final config must come from a combined
   run** — Testing "this one change vs none" misses interactions between changes. On
   2026-08-21 two independently-validated changes cancelled out: blocking `evr`/`sos`
   alone moved total return −15.82%→−6.31%, tightening the stop 12%→5% alone moved
   −5.71%→+7.31%, but stacking both gave −0.14% — 7.45pct worse than the stop alone,
   because both target the same failure (Trend-track losses) and the freed slots went to
   weaker second-tier Accum candidates. Ship the ablation, not the sum of the parts.

## Gate Levels

- **Fast gate (local/default)**: `.venv/bin/ruff check .`, `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`, `.venv/bin/python scripts/quality_gate.py --check-functions`, and focused tests for touched code.
- **Full gate (CI/release)**: fast gate plus `.venv/bin/python scripts/check_workflow_hygiene.py`, `.venv/bin/python scripts/check_dependency_hygiene.py`, full `pytest`, TypeScript strict mode, web and API tests, Pages-functions build, and dry-run jobs where relevant.

## CI and Submission Contract

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the executable source of truth. `AGENTS.md` defines the contributor contract; if the two disagree, update this file in the same PR instead of treating stale instructions as an exception.
- Do not claim a change is ready to merge from local checks alone. Required CI jobs must be successful; `queued`, `in_progress`, `skipped`, and `continue-on-error` coverage are not a green merge gate.
- Run the full web gate for web changes from `web/`: `CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, TypeScript check, both package test suites, and the Pages-functions build. Do not use an interactive dependency repair as validation.
- The CI runner installs Ruff independently. Keep the local toolchain compatible, but when local and CI results differ, resolve against the CI version and record the successful CI run before merging.
- For workflow, schedule, environment-variable, prompt, or operational-contract changes, update the affected documentation and the independent `wiki_repo_new/` checkout in the same delivery.

## Architecture Constraints

- **Web: no new pages** — New features go into the Agent (chat) interface, not as separate routes.
- **No Streamlit in main** — Streamlit is no longer maintained on `main`; route product work through CF Pages, CLI, MCP, or GitHub Actions.
- **Data isolation: Route A** — Signals are shared; portfolio and settings are per-user.
- **Python ≥ 3.11**, **Node ≥ 20**, **pnpm** for web workspace.
- The standalone `wiki_repo_new/` checkout is intentionally hidden and independently versioned; keep it ignored and do not merge it into `docs/`.
- **Chart annotations are desktop-only and display-only** — `annotate_chart` writes to `~/.wyckoff/annotations.json`, is visible only in the Electron app, and never touches positions or orders, so it is a read tool and must not require approval. Drawing an annotation is not a substitute for stating the conclusion in the reply.

## Documentation Synchronization

- Current code, workflow configuration, and live data contracts are the source of truth. Do not preserve documentation text that conflicts with implementation.
- Every change to strategy semantics, report fields, prompts, scheduled workflows, environment variables, SQL tables, CLI/MCP/Web tools, or operational behavior must update the affected `README*`, `GLOSSARY.md`, and `docs/` pages in the same change.
- The independent `wiki_repo_new/` repository must be reviewed for the same change and committed separately when affected. Keep its content aligned with code rather than copying stale prose from `docs/`.
- Before submission, search documentation for renamed files, removed symbols, changed defaults, and old execution wording. In particular, keep research states (`pending`, `confirmed`, `起跳板`) distinct from executable decisions (`BUY` after market and OMS gates).
- Do not commit one-off SQL migration files after the migration has been applied unless the repository explicitly adopts migration history as a maintained product artifact.
